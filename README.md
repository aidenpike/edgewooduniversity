I made a scenario so I'm gonna code it

## Scenario
Edgewood University has hired you to create a program to sort a student's assignments based on their classes. They will be prompted to enter how many classes they have, as well as the name for each class. Additionally, they will need to define how many assignments they have, and the name for each one. The end goal will be to sort all assignments into their correct classes in a neat list.
